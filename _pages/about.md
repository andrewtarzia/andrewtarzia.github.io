I am now an Assistant Professor at the University of Birmingham and leader of the [Tarzia Research Group](https://TarziaResearchGroup.github.io), working to integrate computational tools for molecular materials design with experimental activities.

From 2022-2025, I worked as a Fixed-term assistant professor (RTD-a; funded by the National Recovery and Resilience Plan (PNRR)) at Politecnico di Torino with the [Pavan Lab](https://gmpavanlab.polito.it/).

I worked as a postdoc in the [Jelfs Materials Group](https://jelfs-group.org) at Imperial College London on the development of software and methods for the efficient screening of coordination cages and other (supra)molecular materials. 

I carried out my PhD at the University of Adelaide in Australia as a member of the [Huang](https://huang-lab.org/) and [Sumby-Doonan](http://www.sumbydoonangroup.com/) research groups and with support from the CSIRO. I studied the use of high-throughput methods to explore the chemical space of functional porous materials.

I am actively developing open-source codes and databases for molecular materials discovery. My research focusses on the side-by-side workflows of experimental and computational chemists toward high-success materials synthesis.
